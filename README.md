# Kotlin Collections Task 1 - Monkey Names

Learning how to work with collections (e.g. MutableList) in Kotlin

## The Task

```
     __v__
    ( o o )   __v__
     (---)   ( o o )
              (---)
 
```

Oh, no! There are monkeys loose in your house. You had better collect all their names so that you can report them to the authorities!
